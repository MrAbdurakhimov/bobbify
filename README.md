## Preliminaries
This application doesn't have any demo or production hosted version to see how it's works. However, with the given tutorial below,
you can startup your own one and see this app in production.

## Test & Deploy
In order to startup the project, make sure that you have C++11 compilers installed on your PC! Then install node modules with command below:
```bash
// Installing modules on Server Side
cd ./server
npm install

// Installing modules on Client Side
cd ../client
npm install

// Getting back to root folder
cd ..
```
> You're done with setup! Now, you can proceed to localhost hosting process. So to host it on localhost, follow the codes below:

### For the Server part, execute this
```bash
// Head to the server folder
cd ./server
